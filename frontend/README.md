# RideSharing Frontend (Vite + React)

This is a minimal React frontend for the RideSharing MERN app.

Quick start:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default. The frontend talks to the backend on `http://localhost:5000` at `/api/auth/*`. You can change the backend base by setting `VITE_API_BASE` in your environment.
